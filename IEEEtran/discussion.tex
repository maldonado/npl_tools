Thus far, we have seen that our NLP-based approach can perform well in classifying \SATD. However, there are some observations that warrant further investigation. For example, when it comes to the different types of \SATD, we find that requirement debt tends to require less training data, which is another interesting point that is worth further investigation. 

\revised{Moreover, we think that is also interesting to know the performance of our approach when trained to distinguish between \SATD and non-\SATD.}{R2-10} 

 Lastly, when performing our classification, there are a number of underlying classifiers that can be used in the Stanford Classifier, hence we investigate what is the impact of using a different underlying classifier. 
%In this paper we propose an approach to identify \SATD comments using NLP. This tool, once trained correctly, can automatically classify natural language text. We create a training dataset of \SATD comments and analyzed the classification performance across ten open source projects. In RQ1, we show that our approach can outperform the current state-of-the-art in 10 out of 10 projects while identifying design and requirement debt. However, is not clear the reason why our approach was not equally effective across all projects. For example, JEdit has the worst F1 measure of all projects while classifying requirement \SATD.

%\subsection{Investigating Outliers Projects}
%By investigating JEdit comments, we notice two main reasons. First, the project has 10,322 comments. Of those only 14 are requirement \SATD. The data distribution represents a challenge to the classification. Even though the dataset is very unbalanced our precision was 0.125, which compared with the simple (random) baseline precision of 0.001, shows that our approach is still much more useful. Second, most requirement \SATD comments in this project are in the middle of long comments. 
%
%\everton {Since our approach creates a high number of prediction features for \SATD comments and also for comments without technical debt (i.e., positive and negative weight features), long comments have more chances to match a larger set of negative weight features that will lead to the without technical debt classification. Therefore, long comments can generate `noise' that hinders the classification performance of requirement \SATD. Based on our dataset, requirement \SATD comments are short comments having, on average, 81 characters. However, the average size of requirement \SATD comments from JEdit is 149 characters, 1.8$\times$ bigger than the overall average. Assuming that long requirement \SATD comments can be found in more projects that are not analyzed in our work, one can add these hypothetical comments to increment the current training dataset. Nevertheless, based on the projects that were analyzed, we argue that the current training dataset can identify requirement \SATD effectively and long requirement \SATD should be treated as exceptions.}

% \emad{I do not see the point of the 2 paragraphs below}

% \emad{begin: remove} Intuitively we know that each project has its own particularities, and that each group of developers, must often, create a unique way to communicate their concerns with each other. This unique trait of source code comments is inherited from the natural language itself and renders the fully automated prediction of every single \SATD very unlikely. Even when analyzing a old aged project, changes in the context of the application and turnover of developers can reflect changes in the way that source code comments are written. We can notice the impact of these particularities on the detailed performance analysis conducted in RQ3, where we can notice that the addition of more comments can eventually decrease the F1 measure performance.

% For a great portion of \SATD comments there are common traits. Words as `workaround', `hack' are commonly imbued with criticism and the developers sense that this is not the appropriate solution for the problem in hand. However, relying just in these words for the identification of \SATD is not good enough as shown in Figures \ref{fig:f1_measure_comparison_design_debt} and \ref{fig:f1_measure_comparison_requirement_debt}. Therefore, NLP techniques, as proposed in our work, are needed in order to effectively identify \SATD comments.

\subsection{Textual Similarity for Design and Requirement Debt}

In RQ2, we hypothesize that one of the reasons that requirement \SATD comments need less training data is because requirement \SATD comments are more similar to each other than design \SATD comments. Therefore, we set out to measure the intra-similarity between the requirement debt comments and the intra-similarity of design debt comments and compare the two.

We start by calculating the term frequency-inverse document frequency \textit{tf-idf} weight of each design and requirement \SATD comment. The tf is the simple count of occurrences that a term (i.e., word) has in a document (i.e., comment). The idf takes into account the number of documents that the term appears. However, as the name implies, the more one term is repeated across multiple documents the less relevant it is. Therefore, let \textit{N} be the total number of documents in a collection, the inverse document frequency (idf) of a term \textit{t} is defined as follows: \(idf_{t} = log\frac{N}{df_{t}}\). The total tf-idf weight of a document is equals to the sum of each individual term tf-idf weight in the document. Each document is represented by a \textit{document vector} in a \textit{vector space model}. 

Once we have the tf-idf weights for the comments, we calculate the \textit{cosine similarity} between the comments. The Cosine similarity can be viewed as the \textit{dot product} of the normalized versions of two document vectors (i.e., two comments) ~\cite{Manning2008book}. The computation of the cosine distance will vary between 0 to 1, where 0 means that the comments are not similar at all and 1 means that the comments are identical.

After calculating the tf-idf we compare each comment to all other comments of the same class and store its cosine similarity. For example, the requirement \SATD dataset contains 757 comments, which will generate a 757$\times$757 matrix (since we compare each comment to all the other comments). Finally, we took the average cosine similarity of each comment of the same type for design and requirement debt and plotted the distribution in Figure \ref{fig:textual_similarity}. Figure \ref{fig:textual_similarity} shows that the median and the upper quartile for requirement \SATD comments are higher than the median and upper quartile for design \SATD. The median for requirement debt comments is 0.018, whereas, the median for design debt comments is 0.011. To ensure that the difference is statistically significant, we perform a Wilcox test to calculate the p-value. The calculated p-value was \textless 2.2e-16 showing that our results is indeed statistically significant (i.e., p \textless 0.001). Considering our findings, our hypothesis is validated, showing that requirement \SATD comments are more similar between them than design \SATD comments are. This may help explain why requirement debt needs a smaller set of textual features to be detected.

\subsection{Distinguishing Self-Admitted Technical Debt from Non-Self-Admitted Technical Debt Comments}

So far, we analyzed the performance of our NLP-based approach to identify distinct types of \SATD (i.e., design and requirement debt). However, a simpler distinction such as \SATD vs non-\SATD can also be interesting in the case those specific categories are not needed. For example, if \SATD is being used as a quality metric assessment, the user might not care about the particular type of debt that is present in the code, but for the total quantity of \SATD that there is. 

In order to compute the performance of our NLP-based approach in this new scenario we execute a similar experiment that in RQ1 and RQ2, but with modified training and test datasets. First, we took all design and requirement \SATD comments and assigned them an unique type i.e., technical debt, and the remainder of comments we kept as without technical debt. Second, we run the maximum entropy classifier in a cross project basis, using the comments of 9 projects to train the NLP classifier and the remainder project comments to test the classification. We repeat this process for each of the ten projects, each time training on 9 projects and testing on the remaining 1 project. Lastly, we analyzed the textual features used to identify the self-admitted technical debt comments.

Table \ref{tbl:nlpbased_performance_comparison} compare the F1-measure between design debt, requirement debt and a combination of both. As we can see, the performance when identifying technical debt is very similar with the performance when identifying design debt. This is expected, as the majority of technical debt comments in the training dataset are indeed design debt. Nevertheless, the performance achieved when identifying design debt was surpassed in projects where our approach performed well identifying requirement debt, for example in Columba (0.601 to 0.750) and SQuirrel (0.540 to 0.593). 

We find that the average performance using the combination of design and requirement \SATD is higher (0.636) than the performance achieved when calculating them individually (0.620 and 0.403 for design and requirement debt respectively).

 % In addition, Table \todo{} provide precision, recall and F1-measure for each one of the projects.

Also, when analyzing the top 10 textual features used to classify \SATD, we find once more, a high similarity with the top 10 textual features used to identify design technical debt. The weigh of the features is attributed in accordance with the frequency that each word is found in the training dataset, and therefore, the top 10 features tend to be similar with the design debt ones as design debt comments represents the majority of \SATD comments in the dataset. Table \ref{tbl:top_ten_features_td_vs_non_td} shows a comparison of the top 10 textual features used to identify design, requirement and self-admitted technical debt comments.

\subsection{Investigating the Impact of the Underlying Classifier of the NLP Classification}
\label{sec:underlying_classifier}
In our work, all the classification done by the Stanford Classifier used a Logistic Regression classifier. However, the Stanford Classifier can use other classifiers. In order to examine the impact of the underlying classifier on our results, we chose the other two algorithms to execute the classification with, namely the Naive Bayes generative classifier and the Binary classifier.

Figures \ref{fig:algorithms_comparison_design} and \ref{fig:algorithms_comparison_requirement} compare the performance between the three different algorithms. We find that Naive Bayes has the worst average F1-measure of 0.30 and 0.05 for design and requirement technical debt, respectively. Based on our findings, the Naive Bayes algorithm favors recall at the expense of precision. For example, while classifying design debt, the average recall was of 0.84 and precision 0.19. The two other algorithms present more balanced results compared to Naive Bayes, and the difference in performance between them is not as accentuate. The Logistic Regression classifier achieved F1-measures of 0.62 and 0.40, while the binary classifier F1-measures were 0.63 and 0.40, for design and requirement \SATD, respectively. Tables \ref{tbl:improvement_f1measure_between_classifiers_design} and \ref{tbl:improvement_f1measure_between_classifiers_requirement} in the Appendix section provide detailed data for each compared algorithm for all ten projects.

Although the Binary classification has a slightly better performance, for our purpose, the Logistical Regression algorithm provide more insightful features. These features were analyzed and presented in RQ2.
