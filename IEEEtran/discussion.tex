In this paper we propose an approach to identify \SATD comments using the Stanford Classifier. This tool, once trained correctly, can automatically classify natural language text. We create a training dataset of \SATD comments and analyzed the classification performance across ten open source projects. In RQ1, we show that our approach can outperform the current state-of-the-art in 10 out of 10 projects while identifying design and requirement debt. However, is not clear the reason why our approach was not equally effective across all projects. For example, JEdit has the worst F1 measure of all projects while classifying requirement \SATD.

\subsection{Investigating Outliers Projects}
By investigating JEdit comments, we notice two main reasons. First, the project has 10,322 comments. Of those only 14 are requirement \SATD. The data distribution represents a challenge to the classification. Even though the dataset is very unbalanced our precision was 0.125, which compared with the simple (random) baseline precision of 0.001, shows that our approach is still much more useful. Second, most requirement \SATD comments in this project are in the middle of long comments. \everton {Since our approach creates a high number of prediction features for \SATD comments and also for comments without technical debt (i.e., positive and negative weight features), long comments have more chances to match a larger set of negative weight features that will lead to the without technical debt classification. Therefore, long comments can generate `noise' that hinders the classification performance of requirement \SATD. Based on our dataset, requirement \SATD comments are short comments having, on average, 81 characters. However, the average size of requirement \SATD comments from JEdit is 149 characters, 1.8$\times$ bigger than the overall average. Assuming that long requirement \SATD comments can be found in more projects that are not analyzed in our work, one can add these hypothetical comments to increment the current training dataset. Nevertheless, based on the projects that were analyzed, we argue that the current training dataset can identify requirement \SATD effectively and long requirement \SATD should be treated as exceptions.}

% \emad{begin: remove} Intuitively we know that each project has its own particularities, and that each group of developers, must often, create a unique way to communicate their concerns with each other. This unique trait of source code comments is inherited from the natural language itself and renders the fully automated prediction of every single \SATD very unlikely. Even when analyzing a old aged project, changes in the context of the application and turnover of developers can reflect changes in the way that source code comments are written. We can notice the impact of these particularities on the detailed performance analysis conducted in RQ3, where we can notice that the addition of more comments can eventually decrease the F1 measure performance.

% For a great portion of \SATD comments there are common traits. Words as `workaround', `hack' are commonly imbued with criticism and the developers sense that this is not the appropriate solution for the problem in hand. However, relying just in these words for the identification of \SATD is not good enough as shown in Figures \ref{fig:f1_measure_comparison_design_debt} and \ref{fig:f1_measure_comparison_requirement_debt}. Therefore, NLP techniques, as proposed in our work, are needed in order to effectively identify \SATD comments.

\subsection{Investigating the Impact of the Underlying Classifier of the NLP Classification}

In our work, all the classification done by the Stanford Classifier used a Logistic Regression classifier. However, it would be interesting to see how other algorithms perform when classifying our dataset. Then, we choose two other algorithms to execute the classification with, namely the Naive Bayes generative classifier and the Binary classifier.

Figures \ref{fig:algorithms_comparison_design} and \ref{fig:algorithms_comparison_requirement} compare the performance between the three different algorithms. \everton {We find that the Naive Bayes has the worst average F1-measure of 0.30 and 0.05 for design and requirement technical debt, respectively. Based on our findings, the Naive Bayes algorithm favors recall at the expense of precision. For example, while classifying design debt, the average recall was of 0.84 and precision 0.19. The two other algorithms present more balanced results compared to Naive Bayes, and the difference in performance between them is not as accentuate. The Logistic Regression classifier achieved F1-measures of 0.62 and 0.40, while the binary classifier F1-measures for design and requirement \SATD is 0.63 and 0.40, respectively. Tables \ref{tbl:improvement_f1measure_between_classifiers_design} and \ref{tbl:improvement_f1measure_between_classifiers_requirement} in the Appendix section provide detailed data for each compared algorithm.}  

Although the Binary classification has a slightly better performance, for our research purpose, the Logistical Regression algorithm provide more insightful features as outcome. These features were analyzed and presented in RQ2. 

\subsection{Textual Similarity for Design and Requirement Debt}

% tf-idf formula \(tf-idf_{t,d}=tf_{t,d}\times idf_{t} \)
 % \cite{Manning2008book}

As mentioned in RQ2, we find that one of the reasons that requirement \SATD comments need less training data is because requirement \SATD comments are more similar between them than design \SATD comments are. To support our claim, we calculate the \textit{tf-idf} weight of each design and requirement \SATD comment.Then, we use the \textit{tf-idf} weight to calculate the \textit{cosine similarity} between them. 

The \textit{tf-idf} weight is the resulting computation of two other metrics: \textit{term frequency} (tf) and \textit{inverse document frequency} (idf). \textit{Term frequency} is the simple count of occurrences that a term (i.e., word) has in a document, that in our case, is the source comment. The \textit{inverse document frequency} takes into account the number of documents that the term appears. However, as the name implies, the more one term is repeated across multiple documents the less relevant it is. Therefore, denoting the total number of documents in a collection by \textit{N}, the \textit{inverse document frequency} (idf) of a term \textit{t} is defined as follows: \(idf_{t} = log\frac{N}{df_{t}}\). Once calculated the \textit{tf-idf} weight of each word in a comment, we sum them obtaining the  \textit{tf-idf} weight for the whole comment. At this point, each comment is represented as a vector \everton{stopped here}
