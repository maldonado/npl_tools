\begin{abstract}
During the development of a software system developers face unpredictable difficulties, and in many cases they apply unconventional solutions such as hacks and workarounds. The \textit{metaphor} of \textit{technical debt} was introduced to express this trade off between productivity and quality. More recently, our work has shown that it is possible to detect technical debt using source code comments (i.e., self-admitted technical debt), and that the most common types of self-admitted technical debt are design and requirement debt. However, this approach heavily depends on the manual classification of source comments. In this paper we present an approach to automatically identify design and requirement \SATD using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based classifier. We studied ten open source projects: Apache Ant, Apache Jmeter, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL. We find that the average F1 measure achieved when identifying \SATD outperforms the current state-of-the-art technique, which detects technical debt using comment pattents, 4.5 times. During our analysis we evaluate and present the top 10 most impacting words while classifying \SATD. Lastly, we find that training datasets as small as 1,444 design debt comments and 380 requirement debt comments are adequate to identify \SATD comments. To facilitate future work we make publicly available the dataset of classified comments used in this study containing more than 62K comments.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

\IEEEPARstart{D}{evelopers} often have to deal with conflicting goals that require software to be delivered quickly, with high quality, and on budget. In practice, achieving all of these goals at the same time can be challenging, causing a tradeoff to be made. Often, these tradeoffs lead developers to take \emph{shortcuts} or use \emph{workarounds}. Although such shortcuts help developers in meeting their short-term goals, they may have a negative impact in the long-term.

Technical debt is a metaphor coined to express sub-optimal solutions that are taken consciously in a software project in order to achieve some short-term goals~\cite{Cunningham1992WPM}. Generally, these decisions allow the project to move faster in the short-term, but introduce an increased cost (i.e., debt) to maintain this software in the long run~\cite{Seaman2011,Kruchten2013IWMTD}. Prior work has shown that technical debt is widespread in the software domain, is unavoidable, and can have a negative impact on the quality of the software~\cite{Lim2012Software}.

Due to the importance of technical debt, a number of studies empirically examined technical debt and proposed techniques to enable its detection and management. The main findings of the prior work are three-fold. First, there are different types of technical debt, e.g., defect debt, design debt, testing debt, and that among them design debt has the highest impact~\cite{Alves2014MTD,Marinescu2012IBM}. Second, static source code analysis helps in detecting technical debt, (i.e., code smells)~\cite{Marinescu2004ICSM,Marinescu2010CSMR,Zazworka2013CSE}. Third, more recently, our work has shown that it is possible to identify technical debt through source comments, referred to as  \SATD~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}, and that design and requirement debt are the most common types of \SATD~\cite{Maldonado2015MTD}.

The recovery of technical debt through source code comments has three main advantages over traditional approaches based on source code analysis. First, it is more lightweight compared to source code analysis, since it does not require the construction of Abstract Syntax Trees or other more advanced source code representations. The source code comments can be easily and efficiently extracted from source code files using regular expressions.
% such as control flow graphs, and program dependence graphs in order to match structural code smell patterns and compute metrics.
Second, it does not depend on arbitrary metric threshold values, which are required in all metric-based code smell detection approaches.
Deriving appropriate threshold values is a challenging open problem that has attracted the attention and effort of several researchers~\cite{Oliveira:2014,Fontana:2015,Fontana:EMSE:2015}.
Finally, and more importantly, it is a more reliable approach for the recovery of technical debt, since it is based on comments written by the developers themselves, who admit the existence of technical problems that should be addressed in the future.
%On the contrary, all approaches based on source code analysis suffer from high false positive rates~\cite{Ferme:2013} (i.e., they flag a large number of source code elements as problematic, while they are not perceived as such by the developers), because they rely only on the structure of the source code to detect code smells without taking into account the developer's opinion and the project domain. \emad{not sure this is relevant here}

Despite the advantages of recovering technical debt from source code comments, the research in \SATD, thus far, heavily relies on manual inspection of code comments. The current-state-of-the art approach~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME} uses 64 comment patterns (i.e., words and phrases) derived after the manual examination of more than 100k comments. The manual inspection of code comments is subject to the reader bias, it is time consuming and, as any other manual task, susceptible to errors. These limitations in the identification of \SATD comments renders the current state-of-the-art approach difficult to be applied in practice.

Therefore, in this paper we investigate the efficiency of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically detect the two most common types of \SATD, namely design and requirement debt. We analyze ten open source projects from different application domains, namely, Apache Ant, Apache Jmeter, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL. We extract and classify the source comments of these projects. Then, using the classified dataset we train the Stanford NLP Classifier~\cite{Manning2014ACL} to identify design and requirement \SATD.
The advantages of the NLP Classifier over keyword-based and pattern-based approaches, such as~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}, are twofold. First, the NLP classifier automatically extracts the most important features (i.e., words) for each class based on a classified training dataset given as input. Second, the NLP classifier apart from finding features that contribute positively to the classification of a comment in a given class, finds also features that contribute negatively to the classification of a comment in a given class.

We perform a leave-one-out cross-project validation (i.e., we train on nine projects and test on one project). Our results show that we are able to  achieve an average F1-measure of 0.620 while identifying design \SATD, and an average F1-measure of 0.403 while identifying requirement \SATD. We compare the performance of our approach to a simple (random) baseline and the state-of-the-art approach used to detect \SATD~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}. Our results show that on average, we outperform the simple baseline by more than 7 times and the state-of-the-art by 4.5 times, when detecting design debt, and 18 times when detecting requirement debt.

To better understand how developers express technical debt we analyze the 10 most prevalent words appearing within \SATD comments. For example, words as `hack', `workaround' and `yuck!' are used to express design \SATD, whereas, words such as `todo', `needed' and `implementation' are a strong indicators of requirement debt.
Moreover, to determine the most efficient way to apply our approach, we analyze the amount of training data necessary to identify \SATD. We find that training datasets with at least 1,444 design \SATD comments can achieve high prediction performance. Similarly, for requirement \SATD, training datasets with at least 380 source comments containing requirement \SATD can identify this type of technical debt with high accuracy.  

The main contributions of our work are the following:
\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We provide an automatic, NLP-based, approach for identifying design and requirement \SATD.
  \item We examine and report the words that best indicate design and requirement \SATD.
  \item We show that using a small training set of comments, we are able to effectively detect design and requirement \SATD.
  %analyze the amount of necessary data to effectively apply our approach, making it possible to replicate our study in different contexts than ours (i.e., different idioms or programming languages).
  \item We make our dataset used in this work publicly available so that others can advance work in the area of \SATD
  %. We believe that these are good contributions to future work in the area, and to researchers who are willing to devise new approaches to address the problem of identifying technical debt through the use of code comments.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:approach} describes our approach. We setup our case study and present our
