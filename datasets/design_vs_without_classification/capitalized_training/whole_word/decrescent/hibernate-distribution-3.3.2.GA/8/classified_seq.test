Ideally, the original "user-supplied query" string should be used to retreive this metadata (i.e., not the para-list-expanded query string) to avoid unnecessary cache entries.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	saveOrUpdateCopy() is deprecated!

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a "detached" collection that originally belonged to the same entity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Force a substitution!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The user requested a "greater" (i.e. more restrictive) form of pessimistic lock
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database now holds a lock + the object is flushed from the cache, so release the soft lock
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now update the object .. has to be outside the main if block above (because of collections)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Search for collections by reachability, updating their role. We don't want to touch collections reachable from a deleted object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a situation where the entity id is assigned by a post-insert generator and was saved outside the transaction forcing it to be delayed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE: we need to do the wrap here even if its not "dirty", because collections need wrapping but changes to _them_ don't dirty the container. Also, for versioned data, we need to wrap before calling searchForDirtyCollections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	grab its state saved at deletion

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Among other things, updateReachables() will recursively load all collections that are moving roles. This might cause entities to be loaded.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	So this needs to be safe from concurrent modification problems. It is safe because of how IdentityMap implements entrySet()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Update the status of the object and if necessary, schedule an update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Schedule updates to collections:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity inserts/updates in order to account for bidi associations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Post-flushing section ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database has changed now, so the subselect results need to be invalidated

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	even though we might find a pre-existing element by join path, we may not be able to reuse it...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE : addDuplicateAlias() already performs nullness checks on the alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the from-clauses are the same, we can be a little more aggressive in terms of what we reuse
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again, null != null here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this is an implied join in a from element, then use the impled join type which is part of the tree parser's state (set by the gramamar actions).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise (subquery case) dont reuse the fromElement if we are processing the from-clause of the subquery

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Append the new property name onto the unresolved path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the lhs is a collection, use CollectionPropertyMapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Tell the destination fromElement to 'includeSubclasses'.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use theta style (for regression) Move the node up, after the origin node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Don't resolve the node again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for expected parameter type injection, we expect that the lhs represents some form of property ref and that the children of the in-list represent one-or-more params.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to strip off the embedded parens so that sql-gen does not double these up

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Now, set the text for this node. It should be the element columns.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Get the function return value type, based on the type of the first argument.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the property is a special collection property name, return a CollectionPropertyMapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Collection of components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure the lhs is "assignable"...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	false indicates to not generate parens around the assignment

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Note: this simply constructs a "raw" SQL_TOKEN representing the where fragment and injects this into the tree. This "works"; however it is probably not the best long-term solution. At some point we probably want to apply an additional grammar to properly tokenize this where fragment into constituent parts focused on the operators embedded within the fragment.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Append the text of the current node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the node has a first child, recurse into the first child.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	bit_length feels a bit broken to me. We have to cast to char in order to pass when a numeric value is supplied. But of course the answers given will be wildly different for these two datatypes. 1234.5678 will be 9 bytes as a char string but will be 8 or 16 bytes as a true numeric. Jay Nance 2006-09-22

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Named Queries:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this will throw an error if there's something wrong.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	does not handle arrays (thats ok, cos they can't be lazy) or newly instantiated collections, so we can do the cast
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection deletions are a special case since update() can add deletions of collections not loaded by the session.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we can do the cast since orphan-delete does not apply to: 1. newly instantiated collections 2. arrays (we can't track orphans for detached arrays)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the natural-id is marked as non-mutable, it is not retrieved during a normal database-snapshot operation...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	watch out for a case where old is still referenced somewhere in the object graph! (which is a user error)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	slice, to get the columns for this component property
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	int result = 17; result = 37 result + type.hashCode(); result = 37 result + ( value==null ? 0 : value.hashCode() ); return result;
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The CollectionEntry.isReached() stuff is just to detect any silly users who set up circular or shared references between/to collections.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	detached collection wrappers that get found + reattached during flush shouldn't be ignored
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The unique property value represented here may or may not be serializable, so we do an explicit check here in order to generate a better error message
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the version of a newly instantiated object is not the same as the version seed value, use that as the unsaved-value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. we never have to null out a reference to an uninitialized proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore this row, the collection is in process of being loaded somewhere further "up" the stack
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Entity load contexts ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ currently, not yet used...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should be ok performance-wise to generate new delegate instances for each request since these are locally stack-scoped. Besides, it makes the code much easier to read than the old TransactionHelper stuff...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this implementation is supposed to tolerate incorrect unsaved-value mappings, for the purpose of backward-compatibility
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	wrap up any new collections directly referenced by the object or its components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remove any snapshot, not really for memory management purposes, but rather because it might now be stale, and there is no longer any EntityEntry to take precedence This is now handled by removeEntity() session.getPersistenceContext().removeDatabaseSnapshot(key);
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	skip this check for composite-ids relating to dom4j entity-mode; alternatively, we could add a check to make sure the incoming id value is an instance of Element...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	upgrade the lock if necessary: lock(result, lockMode);
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now, any collections that are initialized inside this block do not get updated - they are ignored until the next flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we must clone embedded composite identifiers, or we will get back the same instance that we pass in
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Sub-insertions should occur before containing insertion so Try to do the callback now
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the entity is not associated with the session, so try interceptor and unsaved-value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	scan the query string for class names appearing in the from clause and replace with all persistent implementors of the class/interface, returning multiple query strings (make sure we don't pick up a class in the select clause!)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save() operations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	evict() operations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	stops flush being called multiple times if this method is recursively called
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is an uninitialized proxy, pointing with this session, then when it is accessed, the underlying instance will be "contained"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Generate an explicit join for the root dot node. The implied joins will be collected and passed up to the root dot node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	A session is considered to contain an entity only if the entity has an entry in the session's persistence context and the entry reports that the entity has not been removed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Does the collection referenced by this FromElement specify an order-by attribute? If so, attach it to the query's order-by
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	... and the token could be an identifer and the error is a mismatched token error ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If a where clause was specified in the update/delete query, use it to limit the returned ids here...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	int parameterStart = getWalker().getNumberOfParametersInSetClause(); List allParams = getIdSelectParameterSpecifications(); Iterator whereParams = allParams.subList( parameterStart, allParams.size() ).iterator();
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Default implementation: If this node has a data type, and that data type is not an association, then this is scalar.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Resolve the LHS fully, generate implicit joins. Pass in the property name so that the resolver can discover foreign key (id) properties.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the propertyType is null and there isn't a parent, just stop now... there was a problem resolving the node anyway.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We do not look for an existing join on the same path, because it makes sense to join twice on the same collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	our parent is another dot node, meaning we are being further dereferenced. thus we need to generate a join unless the parent refers to the associated entity's PK (because 'our' table would know the FK).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	public final Currency getCurrency(int col) throws HibernateException {return (Currency) get(col);}
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here, we have two possibilities: 1) the property-name matches the explicitly identifier property name 2) the property-name matches the implicit 'id' property name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Set the unresolved path in this node and the parent. Set the text for the parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Get the first child to be considered. Sub-classes may do this differently in order to skip nodes that are not select expressions (e.g. DISTINCT).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this is an entity and the property is the identifier property, then use getIdentifierType(). Note that the propertyName.equals( propertyPath ) checks whether we have a component key reference, where the component class property name is the same as the entity id property name; if the two are not equal, this is the case and we'd need to "fall through" to using the property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for a subquery, the alias to use depends on a few things (we already know this is not an overall SELECT): 1) if this FROM_ELEMENT represents a correlation to the outer-most query A) if the outer query represents a multi-table persister, we need to use the given alias in anticipation of one of the multi-table executors being used (as this subquery will actually be used in the "id select" phase of that multi-table executor) B) otherwise, we need to use the persister's table name as the column qualification 2) otherwise (not correlated), use the given alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Not a collection? Return the entity property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection of <many-to-any/> mappings... used to circumvent the component-collection check below...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Otherwise, the destination node was implied by the FROM clause and the FROM clause processor will automatically add it in the right place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the first identifier in the path referrs to the class alias (not the class name), then this is a correlated subselect. If it's a correlated sub-select, use the existing table alias. Otherwise generate a new one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if our "propPath" actually represents a property on the persister
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	An ident node can represent an index expression if the ident represents a naked property ref Note: this makes the assumption (which is currently the case in the hql-sql grammar) that the ident is first resolved itself (addrExpr -> resolve()). The other option, if that changes, is to call resolve from here; but it is currently un-needed overhead.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This uses a PathExpressionParser but notice that compound paths are not valid, only bare names and simple paths:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this is an implied join in a FROM clause, then use ANSI-style joining, and set the flag on the FromElement that indicates that it was implied in the FROM clause itself.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	origin.addDestination(destination); Add the query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For an explicit many-to-many relationship, add a second join from the intermediate (many-to-many) table to the destination table. Also, make sure that the from element's idea of the destination is the destination table.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Reset the node type, because the rest of the system is expecting FROM_FRAGMENT, all we wanted was for the factory to create the right sub-class. This might get reset again later on anyway to make the SQL generation simpler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	explicit = true; This is an explict Select. ArrayList sqlResultTypeList = new ArrayList();
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlResultTypeList.add( type ); Generate the select expression.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the expression list has exactly one expression, and the type of the expression is a collection then this might be a collection function, such as index(c) or size(c).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Need to parse off the column qualifiers; this is assuming (which is true as of now) that this is only used from update and delete HQL statement parsing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for regression testing against output from the old parser... found it easiest to simply reorder the FromElements here into ascending order in terms of injecting them into the resulting sql ast in orders relative to those expected by the old parser; this is definitely another of those "only needed for regression purposes". The SyntheticAndFactory, then, simply injects them as it encounters them.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The uber-rule here is that we need to include subclass joins if the FromElement is in any way dereferenced by a property from the subclass table; otherwise we end up with column references qualified by a non-existent table reference in the resulting SQL...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classic translator does not support collection of ordinal param metadata
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression in the list of nested subexpressions we are currently processing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The loop ensures atomicity of the select + update even for no transaction or read committed isolation level
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not be able to reach last without maxPosition being set unless there are no results
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we found it in the temp PC. Should indicate we are in the midst of processing a result set containing eager fetches via join fetch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not use proxiesByKey, since not all proxies that point to this session's instances are in that collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there is no TM configured, we will not be able to access the javax.transaction.Transaction object in order to register a synch anyway.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Since the result set cursor is always left at the first physical row after the "last processed", we need to jump back one position to get the key value we are interested in skipping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	true if this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role otherwise this is a CollectionInitializer and we are loading up a single collection or batch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don't need to worry about existing version being uninitialized because this block isn't called by a re-entrant load (re-entrant loads _always_ have lock mode NONE)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add temp entry so that the next step is circular-reference safe - only needed because some types don't take proper advantage of two-phase-load (esp. components)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume we are in an auto-commit state
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	log a message about potential connection leaks
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ps.close(); just close it; do NOT try to return it to the pool! NOTE: early exit!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this has been shown to happen occasionally in rare cases when using a transaction manager + transaction-timeout where the timeout calls back through Hibernate's registered transaction synchronization on a separate "reaping" thread. In cases where that reaping thread executes through this block at the same time the main application thread does we can get into situations where these CMEs occur. And though it is not "allowed" per-se, the end result without handling it specifically is infinite looping. So here, we simply break the loop
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unfortunately this stuff can't be cached because it is per-invocation, not constant for the QueryTranslator instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can't cache this stuff either (per-invocation) we are given a map of user-alias -> lock mode create a new map of sql-alias -> lock mode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don't create a unique key, 'cos some databases don't like a UK on nullable columns getCollectionTable().createUniqueKey( getIdentifier().getConstraintColumns() );
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ stuff that is persister-centric and/or EntityInfo-centric ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isSet = collection.isSet(); isSorted = collection.isSorted();
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	lists, arrays sets, maps, bags
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we finish all the "removes" first to take care of possible unique constraints and so that we can take better advantage of batching
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a combination of foreign key columns and pk columns, since the ordering of removal and addition is not guaranteed when a child moves from one parent to another
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ stuff that is persister-centric and/or EntityInfo-centric ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	information about properties of this class, including inherited properties (only really needed for updatable/insertable properties)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	all this only really needs to consider properties of this class, not its subclasses, but since we are reusing code used for sequential selects, we use the subclass closure
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated. For partial component generation, we currently just re-select the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the root (versioned) table, and we are using version-based optimistic locking; if we are not updating the version, also don't check it (unless this is a "generated" version column)!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimistic-lock="all", include all updatable properties optimistic-lock="dirty", include all properties we are updating this time
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this property belongs to the table, and it is not specifically excluded from optimistic locking by optimistic-lock="false"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if the connection is in auto-commit mode (no connection means aggressive connection release outside a JTA transaction context, so MUST be autocommit mode)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to treat this as if it where optimistic-lock="all" (dirty does not make sense); first we need to locate the "loaded" state Note, it potentially could be a proxy, so perform the location the safe way...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we always assume an instance with a null identifier or no identifier property is unsaved!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Need to use the identifier type of the collection owner since the incoming is value is actually the owner's id. Using the collection's key type causes problems with property-ref keys...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow any identifier quoted with backtick only recognizes identifiers beginning with a letter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	following doesn't handle (null, not null) but unnecessary since this would mean all rows
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	IMPL NOTE : due to the delayed population of setters (setters cached for performance), we really cannot pro0perly define equality for this transformer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to dirty check collections, since they can cause an owner version number increment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the id, so we can use it to reset the proxy id return result;
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimizer = getFactory().getSettings().getBytecodeProvider().getReflectionOptimizer( mappedClass, getterNames, setterNames, propTypes );
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache the actual id of the object, not the value of the property-ref, which might not be initialized
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We now have the value of the property-ref we reference. However, we need to dig a little deeper, as that property might also be an entity type, in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Retrieve the value of the designated column in the current row of this ResultSet object as a java.io.Reader object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not absolutely necessary, but helps for some equals()/hashCode() implementations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should be a call to resolve(), not resolveIdentifier(), 'cos it might be a property-ref, and we did not cache the referenced value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we have <tt>not-found="ignore"</tt> association mapped to a formula, we always need to dirty check it, so we can update the second-level cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can't just return null here, since that would cause an owning component to become null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays, replaceElements() may return a different reference, since the array length might not match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	actual cache of the entries. soft references are used for both the keys and the values here since the values pertaining to the MRU entries are kept in a seperate hard reference cache (to avoid their enqueuement/garbage-collection).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as soon as we encounter our first letter, return the substring from that position
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Note : expected in the syntax: type=listenerClass ({sep}type=listenerClass) where {sep} is any whitespace or comma
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isTransactionCallbackRegistered denotes whether any Hibernate Transaction has registered as a callback against this JDBCContext; only one such callback is allowed. Directly serializing this value causes problems with JDBCTransaction, or really any Transaction impl where the callback is local to the Transaction instance itself, since that Transaction is not serialized along with the JDBCContext. Thus we handle that fact here explicitly...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note that for sequential scrolling, we make the assumption that the first persister element is the "root entity"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We call getKeyFromResultSet() here so that we can know the key value upon which to perform the breaking logic. However, it is also then called from getRowFromResultSet() which is certainly not the most efficient. But the call here is needed, and there currently is no other way without refactoring of the doQuery()/getRowFromResultSet() methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This check is needed since processing leaves the cursor after the last physical row for the current logical row; thus if we are after the last physical row, this might be caused by either: 1) scrolling to the last logical row 2) scrolling past the last logical row In the latter scenario, the previous logical row really is the last logical row. In all other cases, we should process back two logical records (the current logic row, plus the previous logical row).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	and perform the load
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	important: reuse the same event instances for performance!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we found a collection element in the result set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we did not find a collection element in the result set, so we ensure that a collection is created with the owner's identifier, since what we have is an empty collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a collection initializer, so we must create a collection for each of the passed-in keys, to account for the possibility that the collection is empty and has no rows in the result set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	grab its state from the ResultSet and keep it in the Session (but don't yet initialize the object itself) note that we acquire LockMode.READ even if it was not requested
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a many-to-many; decrement currentDepth here to allow join across the association table without exceeding MAX_FETCH_DEPTH (i.e. the "currentDepth - 1" bit)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if not a composite key, use "foo in (?, ?, ?)" for batching if no batch, and not a composite key, use "foo = ?"

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlAliasSuffixes[i] = element.getColumnAliasSuffix();
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NONE, because its the requested lock mode, not the actual!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point we have (drivingSqlAlias) the SQL alias of the driving table corresponding to the given user alias. However, the driving table is not (necessarily) the table against which we want to apply locks. Mainly, the exception case here is joined-subclass hierarchies where we instead want to apply the lock against the root table (for all other strategies, it just happens that driving and root are the same).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the column doesnt exist at all.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have a mapped identifier property and the root of the incoming property path matched that identifier property
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have an embedded composite identifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	both many-to-one and one-to-one are represented as a Property. EntityPersister is relying on this value to determine "lazy fetch groups" in terms of field-level interception. So we need to make sure that we return true here for the case of many-to-one and one-to-one with lazy="no-proxy" impl note - lazy="no-proxy" currently forces both lazy and unwrap to be set to true. The other case we are extremely interested in here is that of lazy="proxy" where lazy is set to true, but unwrap is set to false. thus we use both here under the assumption that this return is really only ever used during persister construction to determine the lazy property/field fetch groupings. If that assertion changes then this check needs to change as well. Partially, this is an issue with the overloading of the term "lazy" here...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	decide which ResultSet to get the property value from:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note: it is conceptually possible that a UserType could map null to a non-null value, so the following is arguable:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the contract of EntityTuplizer.determineConcreteSubclassEntityName says that returning null is an indication that the specified entity-name (this.getEntityName) should be used.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Need to use the identifier type of the collection owner since the incoming is value is actually the owner's id. Using the collection's key type causes problems with property-ref keys...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache these since they are stateless this one could even be static...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if an exception occurs during flush, user must call rollback()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Essentially: 1) If we have a local (Hibernate) transaction in progress and it already has the UserTransaction cached, use that UserTransaction to determine the status. 2) If a transaction manager has been located, use that transaction manager to determine the status. 3) Finally, as the last resort, try to lookup the UserTransaction via JNDI and use that to determine the status.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	package
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	swallow it (the transaction _was_ successful or successfully rolled back)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to dirty check many-to-ones with not-found="ignore" in order to update the cache (not the database), since in this case a null entity reference can lose information
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create our own copy of the user-supplied tuplizer impl map
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Regions can get instantiated in the course of normal work (e.g. a named query region will be created the first time the query is executed), so suspend any ongoing tx
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	then handle any user-defined entity modes...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Establish the region root node with a non-locking data version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	temporary ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE : this is being used from the process of shutting down a SessionFactory. Specific things to consider: (1) this clearing of the region should not propagate to other nodes on the cluster (if any); this is the cache-mode-local option bit... (2) really just trying a best effort to cleanup after ourselves; lock failures, etc are not critical here; this is the fail-silently option bit...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to extract the component values and check for subtype replacements...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We ignore minimalPutOverride. JBossCache putForExternalRead is already about as minimal as we can get; it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for now, just "re-flatten" the metamodel since this is temporary stuff anyway (HHH-1907)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Configure the cache to use our TM
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This solution would allow us to eliminate the owner arg to disassemble(), but what if the collection was null, and then later had elements added? seems unsafe session.getPersistenceContext().getCollectionEntry( (PersistentCollection) value ).getKey();
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure JBC doesn't look one up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some collections are not lazy:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Here we don't want to suspend the tx. If we do: 1) We might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes. No tx == no WL on cache node, so other threads can prematurely see those query results 2) No tx == immediate replication. More overhead, plus we spread issue #1 above around the cluster
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the (fully resolved) identifier value, but do not resolve to the actual referenced entity instance NOTE: the owner of the association is not really the owner of the id!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Add a zero (or quite low) timeout option so we don't block. Ignore any TimeoutException. Basically we forego caching the query result in order to avoid blocking. Reads are done with suspended tx, so they should not hold the lock for long. Not caching the query result is OK, since any subsequent read will just see the old result with its out-of-date timestamp; that result will be discarded and the db query performed again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Impl note: takes advantage of the fact that an escpaed single quote embedded within a quote-block can really be handled as two seperate quote-blocks for the purposes of this method...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We have the JBCWriteMutex, so no other local thread will be trying to write this key. It's possible here some remote thread has come in and changed the values again, but since we are reading the values to write to JBC right now, we know we are writing the latest values; i.e. we don't assume that what we cached in entry.update() above is what we should write to JBC now. Our write could be redundant, i.e. we are writing what some remote thread just came in an wrote. There is a chance that yet another remote thread will update us, and we'll then overwrite that later data in JBC. But, all remote nodes will ignore that change in their localCache; the only place it will live will be in JBC, where it can only effect the initial state transfer values on newly joined nodes (i.e. populateLocalCache()).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	local cache, so we use synchronization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	local cache, so we use synchronization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Don't need to lock the cache here, since if someone else inserted the same pk first, the insert would fail
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to grab the version value from the entity, otherwise we have issues with generated-version entities that may have multiple actions queued during the same flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to obtain the lock before any actions are executed, since this may be an inverse="true" bidirectional association and it is one of the earlier entity actions which actually updates the database (this action is resposible for second-level cache invalidation only)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	postDelete: After actually deleting a row, record the fact that the instance no longer exists on the database (needed for identity-column key generation), and remove it from the session cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	intentionally empty

DESIGN	'hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults' is a temporary magic value. The need for it is intended to be alleviated with future developement, thus it is not defined as an Environment constant... it is used to control whether we should consult the JDBC metadata to determine certain Settings default values; it is useful to not do this when the database may not be available (mainly in tools usage).

DESIGN	even here, if only properties mapped to the "base table" are referenced in the set and where clauses, this could be handled by the BasicDelegate. TODO : decide if it is better performance-wise to perform that check, or to simply use the MultiTableUpdateDelegate
DESIGN	TODO: switch statements are always evil! We already had bugs because of forgotten token types. Use polymorphism for this!
DESIGN	TODO : we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also; this is difficult because the hql-sql grammar expects all those node types to be FromReferenceNodes. One potential fix here would be to convert the IntoClause to just use a FromClause/FromElement combo (as a child of the InsertStatement) and move all this logic into the InsertStatement. That's probably the easiest approach (read: least amount of changes to the grammar and code), but just doesn't feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from-clauses
DESIGN	really there are two situations where it should be ok to allow the insertion into properties defined on a superclass: 1) union-subclass with an abstract root entity 2) discrim-subclass #1 is handled already because of the fact that UnionSubclassPersister alreay always returns 0 for this call... we may want to disallow it for discrim-subclass just for consistency-sake (currently does not work anyway)...

DESIGN	todo : add the notion of enabled filters to the CacheKey to differentiate filtered collections from non-filtered; but CacheKey is currently used for both collections and entities; would ideally need to define two seperate ones; currently this works in conjuction with the check on DefaultInitializeCollectionEventHandler.initializeCollectionFromCache() (which makes sure to not read from cache with enabled filters). EARLY EXIT!!!!!
DESIGN	for sets, we should end the collection load after resolving the entities, since we might call hashCode() on the elements TODO: or we could do this polymorphically, and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays

DESIGN	todo: this might really even be moved into the cfg package and used as the basis for all things which are configurable.
DESIGN	todo : currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join. This may not be the case for joined-subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy. At some point we should expand this to support that capability. However, that has some difficulties: 1) the biggest is how to handle ORs when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins. 2) here we would need to track each comparison individually, along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the FromElement so it can pass it along to the JoinSequence
DESIGN	this function has a template -> restore output, apply the template and write the result out TODO: Downcast to avoid using an interface? Yuck.
DESIGN	at some point the generate phase needs to be moved out of here, because a single object-level DML might spawn multiple SQL DML command executions. Possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff, but for consistency-sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates (QueryLoader/StatementExecutor) themselves. Also, not sure why QueryLoader currently even has a dependency on this at all; does it need it? Ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegates directly...
DESIGN	get the right object from the list ... would it be easier to just call getEntity() ??

DESIGN	@return collection removal FIXME: even if isInverse="true"?
DESIGN	TODO : will need reference to session factory to fully complete HHH-1907
DESIGN	TODO: currently keeps Getters and Setters (instead of PropertyAccessors) because of the way getGetter() and getSetter() are implemented currently; yuck!
DESIGN	TODO: redesign how PropertyAccessors are acquired...
DESIGN	todo : YUCK!!!
DESIGN	TODO : YUCK!!! fix after HHH-1907 is complete
DESIGN	TODO: need to make the majority of this functionality into a top-level support class for custom impl support
DESIGN	TODO: design new lifecycle for ProxyFactory
DESIGN	TODO: would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly!
DESIGN	TODO: copy/paste from ManyToOneType
DESIGN	TODO: should this be Session.instantiate(Persister, ...)?
DESIGN	TODO: this is a bit arbitrary, expose a switch to the user?
DESIGN	TODO: implement caching?! proxies?!
DESIGN	TODO: is this right??
DESIGN	is this really necessary?
DESIGN	TODO: move these to a new JoinableType abstract class, extended by EntityType and PersistentCollectionType:
DESIGN	TODO: this is very suboptimal for some subclasses (namely components), since it does not take advantage of two-phase-load
DESIGN	worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here...
DESIGN	NOTE VERY HACKISH WORKAROUND!! TODO: Fix this so it will work for non-POJO entity mode
DESIGN	TODO: Fix this so it will work for non-POJO entity mode
DESIGN	We would probably refactor to have LogicParser (builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and, or, not), ExpressionParser (translates from OO terms like foo, foo.Bar, foo.Bar.Baz to SQL terms like FOOS.ID, FOOS.BAR_ID, etc) and PathExpressionParser (which does much the same thing it does now)
DESIGN	TODO: this is a little inefficient, don't need to do a whole deep replaceElements() call
DESIGN	workaround for WebLogic
DESIGN	TODO: this dependency is kinda Bad
DESIGN	ick!
DESIGN	short cut check...
DESIGN	todo : move to StringHelper?
DESIGN	yukky! Don't you have subclasses for that! TODO race conditions can happen here
DESIGN	TODO: We probably should have a StatisticsNotPublishedException, to make it clean
DESIGN	FIXME hack to work around fact that calling Node added = root.addChild( fqn ); doesn't properly set the version on the node
DESIGN	TODO: I considered validating the presence of the TS cache here, but decided to defer unti getQueryCacheInstance() in case the cache is never actually used
DESIGN	need to do that here rather than in the save event listener to let the post insert events to have a id-filled entity when IDENTITY is used (EJB3)
DESIGN	TODO: simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
DESIGN	This, is used by SessionFactoryImpl to hand to the generated SessionImpl; was the only reason I could see that we cannot just use null as Settings.cacheProvider
DESIGN	this is done here 'cos we might only know the type here (ugly!) TODO: improve this a lot:
DESIGN	todo : would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity/subclass would emit a notification which the extendsQueue entries could react to...
DESIGN	TODO : not sure the best way to handle this. The non-performant way :
DESIGN	would be better to use the element-type to determine whether the old and the new are equal here; the problem being we do not necessarily have access to the element type in all cases
DESIGN	This next bit is to allow for both unsaved-value="negative" and for "older" behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object TODO: shift it into unsaved-value strategy
DESIGN	merges don't cascade to uninitialized collections TODO: perhaps this does need to cascade after all....
DESIGN	TODO: an alternative is to check if the owner has changed; if it hasn't then return collection.getOwner()
DESIGN	it is possible that the tree-walking in OuterJoinLoader can get to an association defined by a subclass, in which case the property-ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case, the table name is not known - this temporary solution assumes that the property-ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to (a reasonable guess) TODO: fix this, add: OuterJoinLoadable.getSubclassPropertyTableName(String propertyName)
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context (maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set...) TODO: calling entrySet on an IdentityMap is SLOW!!
DESIGN	important, to account for newly saved entities in query todo : some kind of check for new status...
DESIGN	brand new collection TODO: or an array!! we can't lock objects with arrays now??
DESIGN	TODO: if object was an uninitialized proxy, this is inefficient, resulting in two SQL selects
DESIGN	before cascade! TODO: should this be Session.instantiate(Persister, ...)?
DESIGN	TODO : absolutely no usages of this constructor form; can it go away?
DESIGN	todo : need to find a clean way to handle the "event source" role a seperate classs responsible for generating/dispatching events just duplicates most of the Session methods... passing around seperate reto interceptor, factory, actionQueue, and persistentContext is not manageable...
DESIGN	todo : remove
DESIGN	aliasRefNode.resolve( false, false, aliasRefNode.getText() ); TODO: is it kosher to do it here? TODO: is it kosher to do it here?
DESIGN	No explicit select expression; render the id and properties projection lists for every persister in the from clause into a single 'token node'. TODO: the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filters, we should get rid of derived select clause completely!
DESIGN	TODO : an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements; the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters -> the table info gotten here should really be self-contained (i.e., a class representation defining all the needed attributes), then we could then get an array of those
DESIGN	TODO: get SQL rendering out of here, create an AST for the join expressions. Use the SQL generator grammar to generate the SQL text for the index expression.
DESIGN	TODO : this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DESIGN	TODO: Figure out a better way to get the FROM elements in a proper tree structure. If this is not the destination of a many-to-many, add it as a child of the origin.
DESIGN	work around that crazy issue where the tree contains "empty" FromElements (no text); afaict, this is caused by FromElementFactory.createCollectionJoin()
DESIGN	TODO: this class does too many things! we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent ways in which path expressions can occur
DESIGN	real hacky... used to count the nesting of parentheses
DESIGN	TODO : would be really nice to cache the spec on the query-def so as to not have to re-calc the hash; currently not doable though because of the resultset-ref stuff...
DESIGN	for arrays, we should end the collection load before resolving the entities, since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading TODO: or we could do this polymorphically, and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	polymorphism not really handled completely correctly, perhaps...well, actually its ok, assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here, which it will be
DESIGN	TODO: should "record" how many properties we have reffered to - and if we don't get'em'all we throw an exception! Way better than trial and error ;)
DESIGN	VERY IMPORTANT!!!! - This class needs to be free of any static references to any CGLIB or Javassist classes. Otherwise, users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which (if either) they use. Another option here would be to remove the Hibernate.isPropertyInitialized() method and have the users go through the SessionFactory to get this information.
DESIGN	TODO: is it really neceassry to provide Configuration to CollectionPersisters ? Should it not be enough with associated class ? or why does EntityPersister's not get access to configuration ? The only reason I could see that Configuration gets passed to collection persisters is so that they can look up the dom4j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name was applied at the collection element level. Are you kidding me? Trivial to fix then. Just store and expose the node name on the entity persister (which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means...).
DESIGN	for backward compatibility, allow a set with no not-null element columns, using all columns in the row locater SQL TODO: create an implicit not null constraint on all cols?
DESIGN	SPACES TODO: i'm not sure, but perhaps we should exclude abstract denormalized tables?
DESIGN	workaround, for backward compatibility of sets with no not-null columns, assume all columns are used in the row locator SQL
DESIGN	note that this method could easily be moved up to BasicEntityPersister, if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
DESIGN	index += getPropertyColumnSpan( i ); TODO: this is kinda slow...
DESIGN	TODO: need some caching scheme? really comes down to decision regarding amount of state (if any) kept on PropertyAccessors
DESIGN	TODO: here is why we need to make bytecode provider global :( TODO : again, fix this after HHH-1907 is complete
DESIGN	TODO: Yuck! This is not quite good enough, it's a quick hack around the problem of having a to-one association that refers to an embedded component:
DESIGN	for DOM4J "collections" only TODO: it would be better if this was done at the higher level by Printer
DESIGN	would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff. Would need to change the way the max-row stuff is handled (i.e. behind an interface) so that I could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
DESIGN	TODO: can we always use the "null property" approach for everything?
DESIGN	polymorphism comment above
DESIGN	some messy, complex stuff here, since createCriteria() can take an aliased path, or a path rooted at the creating criteria instance
DESIGN	TODO: really bad, evil hack to fix!!!
DESIGN	ugly hack for cases like "elements(foo.bar.collection)" (multi-part path expression ending in elements or indices)
DESIGN	try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name. this allows the (we assume custom) interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityName
DESIGN	/ HACK ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Attempt to work around "ghost" ImpliedFromElements that occasionally show up between the actual things being joined. This consistently occurs from index nodes (at least against many-to-many). Not sure if there are other conditions Essentially, look-ahead to the next FromElement that actually writes something to the SQL
DESIGN	init the table here instead of earlier, so that we can get a quoted table name TODO: would it be better to simply pass the qualified table name, instead of splitting it up into schema/catalog/table names
DESIGN	TODO : would be great to have a Mapping#hasNonIdentifierPropertyNamedId method I don't believe that Mapping#getReferencedPropertyType accounts for the identifier property; so if it returns for a property named 'id', then we should have a non-id field named id
DESIGN	TODO: is this really necessary????
DESIGN	TODO: ideally we need the construction of PropertyAccessor to take the following: 1) EntityMode 2) EntityMode-specific data (i.e., the classname for pojo entities) 3) Property-specific data based on the EntityMode (i.e., property-name or dom4j-node-name) The easiest way, with the introduction of the new runtime-metamodel classes, would be the the following predicates: 1) PropertyAccessorFactory.getPropertyAccessor() takes references to both a org.hibernate.metadata.EntityModeMetadata and org.hibernate.metadata.Property 2) What is now termed a "PropertyAccessor" stores any values needed from those two pieces of information 3) Code can then simply call PropertyAccess.getGetter() with no parameters; likewise with PropertyAccessor.getSetter()
DESIGN	TODO: this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a Property reference per-se.
DESIGN	todo : this eventually needs to be removed
DESIGN	TODO: make this a bit nicer
DESIGN	todo : we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private...
