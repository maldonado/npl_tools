As mentioned earlier, one of the first works on self-admitted technical debt was the work by Potdar and Shihab~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}. Their work showed that it is possible to identify self-admitted technical debt using source code comments. However, in their work, Potdar and Shihab studied \textit{generic} technical debt, i.e., they did not discriminate between the different types of technical debt. For example, technical debt can be in the form of design debt, testing debt, defect debt, and documentation debt. 

Since our work focuses on \SADTD, we first examined the effectiveness of using the general comments used by Potdar and Shihab to detect design technical debt. We applied the comment patterns that we derived (which we present later in the paper) and the comment patterns from Potdar and Shihab on the studied open source projects. As expected, the results produced by the general comment patterns identified all types of technical debt, indicating the need for more specific comment patterns that can be used to effectively identify design technical debt.

To illustrate our point, we show some example comments flagged by Potdar and Shihab's approach in the first column of Table~\ref{tab:satdmotivation}. The second column of the table shows the comments that are detected by the comment patterns we propose in this paper, which focus on \SADTD. A comparison of the comments in Table~\ref{tab:satdmotivation} clearly shows that the more specific comment patterns detect design issues. 

This simple example shows that comment patterns that specifically target design technical debt are needed. Simply using the general comment patterns may yield unfavourable results. We elaborate more on the performance of using the general comment patterns to detect \SADTD in Section~\ref{sec:case_study_results}.

%Comparing the comments in the table \ref{tab:satdmotivation} with the comments in table \ref{tab:sadtdmotivation} it is clear  that the first approach would not make any distinction between different categories of technical debt like design debt. All of the comments listed is table \ref{tab:sadtdmotivation} are related with design debt in the other hand in table \ref{tab:satdmotivation} is not what happens. We also argue that identifying each specific category of technical debt is important since they are managed and corrected in different ways.
